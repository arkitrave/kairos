## Contributing

We use grunt for running tests and such. If you want to contribute, you
should install the grunt cli and install dependencies.

    sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
    npm install

Once you have done so, you can run any of our grunt tasks.

    grunt watch
    grunt test
    grunt build
    grunt release:(major or minor or patch)
